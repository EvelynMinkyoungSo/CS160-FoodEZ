## Vision Statement

FoodEZe envisions a campus where surplus meals never go to waste and every student has reliable access to food. By seamlessly connecting event organizers with hungry students through real‑time updates and intuitive notifications, we are committed to creating a space where sustainability and collective well‑being go hand in hand.

Our goal is to empower students by sharing resources, to reduce environmental impact, and to build a campus where no plate and no student is left behind.
